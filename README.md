# Emotions-recognizing-algorithms-in-Russian-speech

This repository contains materials from a course paper on the topic "Emotion recognition algorithms in Russian speech".

In the modern world, the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning is actively developing, covering all new areas of human activity. One such area is emotion recognition, which plays an important role in various aspects of our lives, including interpersonal communication, marketing, education, and healthcare. In the context of speech communication, the ability to recognize the emotional state of the interlocutor is key to understanding his intentions, moods and needs.

However, the task of recognizing emotions in speech is a difficult task, due to its versatility, variability and individuality. It is not enough to simply isolate the main emotional states from the speech stream; it is necessary to take into account the context, intonation, lexical features and many other factors. In this regard, the development of algorithms and machine learning models capable of automatically analyzing and classifying emotions in speech seems to be an urgent and important task.

The study was conducted on two datasets: RAVDESS and Dusha. The experimental results showed that the effectiveness of the models strongly depends on the specific data set. The CNN model performed best on the RAVDESS dataset, while the Conformer model proved to be the most effective on the Dusha dataset. The HuBERT model demonstrated average results on both datasets.

	       CNN	  HuBERT	Conformer
RAVDESS	0,89	  0,75	  0,75
Dusha	  0,73	  0,77	  0,83
